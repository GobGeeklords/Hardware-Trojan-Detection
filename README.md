# Hardware Trojan Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting **Hardware Trojans** in digital circuits. Hardware Trojans are malicious modifications to a circuit, which can cause serious security vulnerabilities in hardware systems. The objective of this project is to implement methods for identifying potential Trojan insertions and ensuring the integrity of hardware designs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hardware-trojan-detection.git
    cd hardware-trojan-detection
    ```

2. **Install required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the detection algorithm**:
    ```bash
    python src/detection_algorithm.py --input data/sample_circuits/circuit1.txt
    ```

2. **Test the circuit simulation**:
    ```bash
    python src/circuit_simulation.py --input data/sample_circuits/circuit2.txt
    ```

3. **View detection results**:
    Results will be saved in the `data/results` folder.

## Features

- **Trojan Detection Algorithm**: A custom algorithm designed to detect anomalies in hardware circuits.
- **Circuit Simulation**: Simulates circuits to evaluate their behavior before and after Trojan insertion.
- **Test Cases**: Unit tests included to validate the functionality of the detection algorithm and simulations.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for implementing the detection algorithms and simulations.
- **Verilog/VHDL**: For circuit design files.
- **UnitTest**: Python unit testing framework to validate the methods.
